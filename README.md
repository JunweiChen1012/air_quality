# Air Quality Across Economies: Unveiling the Relationship Between GDP and Pollution in Global Urban Centers
# Overview
This repo contains the code and data to produce the result of the paper "Air Quality Across Economies: Unveiling the Relationship Between GDP and Pollution in Global Urban Centers".
This study delves into the intricate relationship between economic development and air quality in urban centers worldwide, focusing on the impact of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita on the Air Quality Index (AQI) for key pollutants, including Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), and Carbon Monoxide (CO). Leveraging a comprehensive dataset, we conducted exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, and regression analysis to uncover patterns and correlations that illuminate the dynamics between economic activity and environmental health outcomes. Our findings reveal a nuanced landscape where higher GDP per capita generally correlates with better air quality, yet this relationship is complex and influenced by various factors, including urbanization, industrialization, and environmental policies. The study underscores the critical need for integrated approaches that balance economic growth with sustainable urban planning and environmental management to improve air quality and public health. By offering insights into the socio-economic dimensions of air pollution, this research contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable development and environmental stewardship in the face of global urbanization challenges

## File Structure
The repo is structured as the following:

-   `inputs/data` contains the raw data for analysis

-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.

-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean and validate data, as well as helper functions used in these routines.
-   `other` contains sketches and LLM statement

## Statement on LLM usage
some parts of the codes in quarto were written with the help of chatgpt4. all of the chats are added in the Other/LLM/usage.txt.
