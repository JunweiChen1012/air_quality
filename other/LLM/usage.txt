This study delves into the intricate relationship between economic development
and air quality in urban centers worldwide, focusing on the impact of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita on the Air Quality Index (AQI) for key pollutants,
including Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3),
and Carbon Monoxide (CO). Leveraging a comprehensive dataset, we conducted
exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, and regression analysis to uncover
patterns and correlations that illuminate the dynamics between economic activity
and environmental health outcomes. Our findings reveal a nuanced landscape
where higher GDP per capita generally correlates with better air quality, yet this
relationship is complex and influenced by various factors, including urbanization,
industrialization, and environmental policies. The study underscores the critical
need for integrated approaches that balance economic growth with sustainable urban
planning and environmental management to improve air quality and public
health. By offering insights into the socio-economic dimensions of air pollution,
this research contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable development and
environmental stewardship in the face of global urbanization challenges.

This study explores the complex interplay between economic growth and air quality across global urban areas, focusing specifically on the effects of per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on the Air Quality Index (AQI) concerning key pollutants such as Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), and Carbon Monoxide (CO). Utilizing an extensive dataset, we employ exploratory data analysis, correlation assessments, and regression analysis to identify and understand the patterns and relationships that highlight the interaction between economic activities and environmental health outcomes. Our research uncovers a multifaceted relationship wherein generally, a higher GDP per capita is associated with improved air quality. However, this linkage is intricate and modulated by several factors, including the degree of urbanization, industrial activities, and the effectiveness of environmental policies. The findings underscore the imperative for holistic strategies that harmonize economic advancement with sustainable urban development and environmental governance to enhance air quality and public health. By shedding light on the socio-economic aspects of air pollution, our study makes a significant contribution to the ongoing dialogue on sustainable development and environmental protection amid the challenges posed by worldwide urbanization.
